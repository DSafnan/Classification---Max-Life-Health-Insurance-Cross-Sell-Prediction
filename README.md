Max Life Insurance, a leading provider of health insurance in India, 
is seeking to enhance its service offerings by predicting which of its 
existing health insurance policyholders might be interested in purchasing vehicle insurance. 
An insurance policy provides financial compensation for specified losses or damages in exchange 
for regular premium payments. For example, a customer might pay a premium of Rs. 5000 annually 
for a health insurance cover of Rs. 200,000, ensuring coverage for medical expenses. 
This model relies on the concept of risk pooling, where premiums from many customers cover the costs incurred by a few.

Similarly, vehicle insurance requires customers to pay a premium 
to receive compensation in case of vehicle-related accidents or damages. 
By building a predictive model, Max Life Insurance aims to identify which 
health insurance customers are likely to be interested in vehicle insurance. 
This will enable the company to optimize its marketing strategies 
and improve cross-selling opportunities, thereby enhancing its business model and increasing revenue.
